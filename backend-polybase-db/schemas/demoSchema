// This is an example collection definition.
// You should edit it for your use case.

// The language (Polylang) is similar to JavaScript,
// but semi-colons are mandatory.

// The `collection` keyword defines a named collection.
// Collection properties define the "columns" in a record.

// @`public` means that the collection is public, anyone can view and read
// the records in the collection. You can still implement rules on who can 
// edit the data by defining functions on the collection and checking the public key.

@public
collection User {
  // `id` is unique and required on all collections
  id: string;

  // We will use a public key to authenticate function
  // calls later
  publicKey: PublicKey;

  // A mandatory property
  name: string; 


  // `constructor` is called when a new record is
  // created, make sure to assign a value to `this.id`
  constructor (id: string, name: string) {
    // `this.id` must be assigned in the constructor
    // `this.id` must be unique in collection
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    
    // You can assign the publicKey of the user who is
    // creating the record, this can then be used to
    // control permissions for the record (see below)
    this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
  }


  del () {
    if ((this.publicKey).toHex() != ctx.auth) {
